# ppad-black-box-visualiser-haskell

## Ideas

I want to make a visualiser for blackbox PPAD (EOL stuff). Ideally I wanna visualise instance for
1. EoL
2. Source-Or-Excess
3. 2D-StrongSperner
    1. Carve a 2D space and point out the potential directions

Might wanna think how I can add like time/rendering but will let it suffice for now I guess?
- Communication TFNP potentially


Could also extend to other TFNP classes such as CLS/PLS etc.
